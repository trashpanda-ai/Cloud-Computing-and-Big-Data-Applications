# DEBS Challenge '24 -- International Conference on Distributed and Event-based Systems

This repository contains the solution developed by Abner Astete and Jonas Gottal for the DEBS Grand Challenge 2024, as part of the "Cloud Computing and Big Data Applications" course (OT6) at INSA (Institut National des Sciences AppliquÃ©es) Lyon.

## Introduction

Data streaming is essential in the era of big data and event-driven architectures, offering real-time insights, low-latency processing, and scalability. In the context of the DEBS Grand Challenge 2024, our team tackled the challenge of efficiently addressing provided queries on a data stream. Our approach leveraged PySpark, the Python version of Apache Spark. This README outlines our problem structuring and solution-finding process.

### DEBS Challenge

The ACM International Conference on Distributed and Event-Based Systems (DEBS) serves as a leading platform for discussing cutting-edge research in event-based computing, focusing on Big Data, AI/ML, IoT, and Distributed Systems. The 2024 DEBS Grand Challenge involves analyzing SMART data from over 200,000 hard drives provided by Backblaze. The challenge requires the implementation of two queries:

1. **Query 1:** Count of the recent number of failures detected for each vault (group by storage servers) (Continuous Querying).
2. **Query 2:** Use the count obtained from Query 1 to continuously compute a cluster of the drives (K-Means).

### Our Approach

We considered various frameworks and ultimately chose Apache Spark due to its polyglot nature, extensive libraries, and ease of initiating a data stream from a folder of CSV files. PySpark, with its structured streaming capabilities, was advantageous for team members familiar with Python.

## Implementation

### Schema Design

We initiated a structured data stream from CSV files using Apache Spark's Structured Streaming API. The schema for the PySpark data stream is defined as follows:

```python
# Schema for PySpark data stream
schema = StructType([
    StructField("date", TimestampType(), True),
    StructField("serial_number", StringType(), True),
    StructField("model", StringType(), True),
    StructField("failure", IntegerType(), True),
    StructField("vault_id", IntegerType(), True),
    StructField("s1_read_error_rate", IntegerType(), True),
    ...
    StructField("s242_total_lbas_read", IntegerType(), True)
])
```

### First Query Implementation
The first query involves counting the recent number of failures detected for each vault using a sliding window. The PySpark code snippet for this query is as follows:

```python
# Apply Spark operations
windowedData = df \
    .withWatermark("date", "31 days") \
    .groupBy(
        df.vault_id,
        window(df.date, "30 days", "1 day"),
        df.model
    ) \
    .agg(_sum("failure").alias("total_failures"))

selectedData = windowedData.select("window.start", "vault_id", "total_failures")
filteredData = selectedData.filter(selectedData.total_failures > 0)
```

The live output of this query is presented in this Table:


| Start Time           | Vault ID | Total Failures |
|----------------------|----------|----------------|
| 2023-03-31 02:00:00  | 1149     | 1              |
| 2023-06-05 02:00:00  | 1042     | 1              |
| 2023-06-01 02:00:00  | 1097     | 1              |
| 2023-05-24 02:00:00  | 1042     | 1              |
| 2023-06-17 02:00:00  | 1406     | 1              |
| 2023-03-13 01:00:00  | 1124     | 1              |
| ...                  | ...      | ...            |


### Second Query Implementation
The second query involves dynamic K-Means clustering. Due to implementation challenges, the theoretical approach outlined in the README is not fully functional. However, the code includes data normalization and an attempt at implementing the K-Means process.

## Conclusion
While PySpark offered a valuable learning experience, it posed challenges in terms of processing speed and integration into the benchmarking platform. The second query faced implementation challenges within the given time frame. Despite these challenges, the team recognizes PySpark's learning curve and versatile applications.
